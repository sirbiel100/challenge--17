## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss custom properties
- Flexbox
- Scss Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion) - React animation library
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to use useState and useEffect more, I had a lot of difficulties on that part but I think it's normal this difficult in beggining.

### Continued development

I want to continue developing my skills on React and Nextjs.

### Useful resources

- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) - This helped by the documentation itself.
